This repository demonstrates a common off-by-one error in Java when iterating over arrays. The `BuggyArraySum.java` file contains the erroneous code, which attempts to access an array element beyond its bounds. The `CorrectedArraySum.java` file provides the corrected version.  This error is subtle but can lead to unexpected runtime exceptions.  Understanding array bounds is crucial for writing robust Java programs.
